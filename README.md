# This is so simple sql database

## My attempt to write a database
 
### For learning purposes, to better understand the principle of its operation and many other important things for me, namely:
1. How the database works (how to store, process and send data, etc.)
2. How a programming language text parser works using SQL as an example
3. Try to organize an interactive environment in the console (REPL)
4. Binary search tree..
5. In the process, master the C language

I used [this](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial) resource as a starting point
